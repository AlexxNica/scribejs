 Bill McCoy is now digital publishing champion at W3C. Can you give an intro?  I do want to talk about chartering

**BillMcCoy:** hello from W3C staff side  I'm bmccoy@w3.org  I expect to be a more frequent participant in this meeting  I'm happy to be here. Looking forward to a working group.

**garth:** we have some tech discussions on PWP draft  I'd like to move the penultimate agenda item up front  can you go ahead on that?  between BillM and Ivan, we can talk about the business group

#### [pub business group](id:section2)

**BillMcCoy:** the DPUB IG already has rough consensus on a possible direction for WG draft  the most urgent thing is the broader IDPF community gets in the loop soon  so we can get WG charter proposal as soon as possible  so everyone should join publishing BG this week  as soon as the BG is rolling, then they should have input into charter process  the kickoff meeting for Publishing BG will be March 13 in London, details later this week  let's get a WG charter, with input from BG, as soon as possible

**garth:** that matches my 2 cents  the BG kickoff before London Book Fair  and then we discussed a first F2F of digital pub working group in NYC in... May  but there are some issues related to the U.S. going insane politically  so we're not sure if the U.S. is a feature or a bug for meetings  if we're heading for late May/early June f2f, we need to figure that out soon  we have an offer from Adobe to host in NYC  and we could have our co-chair  and BEA brings pub folks to town  we don't need to decide today

**Bill_Kasdorf:** the relationship between this IG and the WG  will this IG wind up if the WG is chartered?  if so, is there anything the IG can do to help smooth the transition

**garth:** I assumed the IG would morph to the WG

**BillMcCoy:** I don't know who's decision that is  bandwidth is a problem  and this group has acted like a WG  so the default assumption is the IG would wind down, and some tasks would move to the BG or the CG  but this group should discuss this

**ivan:** BillK, this is undecided  We haven't discussed too much  are there things that the interest group can do?  the last six-seven months, the IG was preparing for the WG  there are some pending issues around CSS, a11y, etc  which of these should go to the WG, or should they stay separate?  I don't have the answer  if we think there's a need for an IG to stay, then we need to ask ourselves if it's realistic  the community of tech people in publishing is not overly big  we'll have the BG, the WG, some of us may be involved in epub3 maintenance in the CG  we'll have to have chairs, staff people, etc.  one possibility is that the IG dissolves, and people join the WG

**Bill_Kasdorf:** this has a big bearing on the scope of the WG charter  if the IG exists, the WG charter can be narrower  if the IG goes away, WG will need broader charter

**ivan:** what was put into the draft charter are those items that are clearly rec-track work  I did not consider other things  one thing from today's agenda is something from the mailing list  to see exactly what our role be in the continuation of WCAG etc  there's also the CSS-related work  whether that needs to be in the IG, or that can just be in csswg

**garth:** wind-down can be independent of wind-up of WG

**ivan:** aria is a bit different... dpub-aria work is rec-track  so if it stays in IG, we must work with a working group  so that needs to be in WG, and is already in the charter

**garth:** CSS-related work could happen in liason between WG and CSSWG

**ivan:** or the BG

**garth:** so there's at least three groups here--BG, WG, CG  based on bandwidth, I think IG may want to wind down  and all of us may be delighted at Garth's able leadership  but I wouldn't see us doing both

**clapierre1:** the a11y task force published a note on WCAG gaps  that should be considered for the WG

> *dkaplan3*: agreed with charles 100%

 there are certainly some gaps

> *dkaplan3*: many things were left as "future work"

**ivan:** this is separate agenda item

### [WCAG and the WG](id:section3)

 maybe George knows  my understanding is that in the new WCAG charter, the publishing industry's a11y requirements are now in scope  if this is really the case, that WCAG will pick up those items  then I don't think it's helpful if 2 working groups do that work . that can only lead to problems  if WCAG is doing the work, then our job is to liase, offer oversight, bring new issues, review work...  but the work focused on WCAG  if not, then there would need to be a rec from Pubishing WG  but I would be thrilled if admin fell on WCAG

**Avneesh:** the WCAG 2.1 journey started in 2016

> *Avneesh*: "Develop a recommendation-track update to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. This update will clarify and improve applicability to content on mobile devices, in digital publications, and on devices using a wider range of inputs such as touch screens and stylus digitizers, as well as adding improvements to better support users with disabilities including low vision and cognitive, language, and learning impairments."

 that group wanted only dpub-aria, but we added publishing to their scope  this was a reluctand addition to WCAG scope  when we talk about practical things  there are a lot of issues, such as a11y metadata  WCAG doesn't think of this as a high priority  there is a lot of uncertainty there  this is a new thing for them; there is some resistance  we need a big push from the DPUB community  the ball is being passed back and forth. we need to know who is responsible

**garth:** does this need to be nailed down before the WG charter?

**Avneesh:** YES

> *clapierre1*: 1+

 the IDPF has given a high priority to a11y, and we have achieved a lot  we cannot drop that in W3C

**garth:** agreed

**dkaplan3:** I agree with Ivan that having one group focusing is good

> *garth*: adk dk

 one problem with a11y task force was all the different groups with non-ideal communication  but I want to emphasize that, although WCAG is theoretically  open to DPUB concerns  but we are a tiny priority, and they don't understand  that publishing has a separate set of priorities  and people on WCAG don't understand why they are particularly important  So maybe we can get more publishing folks on WCAG  or else we need other groups to advise WCAG  but we can't just hope WCAG will understand today

**ivan:** we will have to have a joint meeting with WCAG

> *BillMcCoy*: +1 to joint meeting w/ WCAG

 we cannot decide unilaterally  there there is the a11y metadata story  I understand that that community never did  I think a11y metadata will be in scope for our WG no matter what  for the WCAG story, the problem I have is that I don't know how modular WCAG is  it was a monolithic document which addressed several things  if we do WCAG work in our WG then we create a different document  a REC is usually under the "control" of one WG  there have been cases in the past where there was a joint publication of two WGs, but that's complicated  so if we do it here, it would not be a formal part of WCAG; it will be a separate document  which concerns me  talking to WCAG people as soon as possible, in next few weeks, will be very important

**garth:** exactly  who does the drafting? is a good question  we need this meeting.

**BillMcCoy:** Jeff and Tim and others want is that there are things in EPUB that could benefit the web as a whole  Media overlays is a great example  it's not specific to publications  but we should be thinking about making this an OWP feature  packaging is another example, something that applies to more than publishing

> *chaals*: [+1 to getting DBup folks into Accessibility group. Note also that there is support for a11y metadata from others who are not currently engaged but understand the requirement - https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/82 â€¦ Note that WCAG 2.1 is essentially working on being able to add *specific, generally applicable* criteria - i.e. it won't make it if it helps some things but breaks others, and it needs to be directly about accessibility]

 but let's do them in a general matter, not a publication-specific manner

**George:** I see that there are items in publishing that are specific to publishing  for example, reading order  there isn't that concept in WCAG, and it's specific to publishing, and very important for a11y  can we identify certain things that are part of publication content that we could develop and have WCAG people review  what is the breakpoint/handoff between the two groups?

**Bill_Kasdorf:** the fate of all the EPUB specs, including the satellite specs, specifically EPUB A11Y 1.0  that was deliberately not an EPUB 3.X spec, but to be referencable outside of EPUB  what happens to those specs in the future?  that's the result of George's push for a baseline a11y spec  I'm not sure it belongs in the EPUB3 CG becasuse that is so EPUB-specific

**ivan:** I think it would be helpful if the a11y experts in the group draft, very explicitly, things you think are very necessary work items  the generalization of the EPUB a11y doc might be one of them  there is the metadata issue  and maybe more to be added to WCAG  we should bring a good list of items to these meetings  I don't have the knowledge to make such a list  so then we can say, for example, metadata is in scope for Pub WG charter, the other things might go to other groups, etc

**dkaplan3:** I'm going to do magic  and answer what Ivan and George asked for  remember the note that the a11y task force published last year?  we know it doesn't cover everything  but this note precisely states our a11y priorities, many of which can be addressed by other groups at w3c  but this is a note to other groups dealing with a11y that we think need to be addressed  so we should remind folks of this  I don't think we should edit it  we need people to act on it

**Avneesh:** epub ally is build on WCAG, but includes stuff missing in WCAG  the techniques are in line with what WCAG does  so this spec, in conjunction with the DPUB note, describe what we need  how do we move EPUB A11Y spec forward in W3C? We don't want to just maintain, we want to move forward

> *BillMcCoy*: EPUB 3 Community Group charter include ongoing development not just "maintenance"

 it would take 3-5 years to put everything in WCAG

> *BillMcCoy*: we can tweak if the language in the starter charter is not clear

 that's not fast enough

**garth:** that's an argument for doing that in this WG?

**Avneesh:** yes  CG looks too weak for more than maintenance

**ivan:** however, my down-to-earth job is to write a charter  and I can't put the a11y note in the charter  I would need the two paragraphs that defines in the charter level this is what this or that WG must deliver

> *chaals*: [WCAG 2.1 is on a very fixed timeline, so you need to have stuff ready for them on that timeline, and the rest might get into 2.2 or whatever comes next, which doesn't *yet* seem to have a time pressure]

 the input docs are these two things (DPUB a11y note and EPUB a11y spec)  then we can go back to WCAG and say, 'this is what we think shoudl be done'  and we can ask them if it's ok if we do it

**ivan:** there is a timeline with WCAG

**Avneesh:** there is some push to put things in WCAG 3, which is a long way off

**garth:** Ivan, it looks like you want a volunteer to draft charter text. Can Deborah or Avneesh do that?

**dkaplan3:** I'll jump in

> *clapierre1*: +1

 the a11y task force put itself on hold  but we're seeing the bat-signal, and need to come out of retirement

**garth:** that sounds like an action item for the a11y task force  and to provide the elevator pitch for a11y in the DPUB charter

> *dkaplan3*: +1

**ivan:** can I add one thing?  if you look at the charter draft, one is the geeral description, which is where I need your help  there are reference docs, which is easy  and there's a liason section  so we have to have a diplomatically acceptable of how we would work together with WCAG  I'll need your help there, too

> *dkaplan3*: Ivan, we'll have to call on you for diplomatic expertise!

**BillMcCoy:** I agree with Ivan about liason with WCAG  occam's razor is for things that will end up in W3C REC  the a11y thing is intended to be a moving target  but scope of epub3 CG should not be just errata, but also ongoing development of things that don't need w3c rec track  I think the a11y stuff might be suitable for the CG  the CG is more than errata

**ivan:** one thing, BillM  as far as I know, the a11y it's much more important for certain docs to be recommendations, due to legal results

> *BillMcCoy*: EPUB 3 is an ISO Technical Specification and we plan to upgrade EPUB 3.1 to ISO Standard

> *BillMcCoy*: EPUB Accessibility as an ISO Specification in 18 months may trump EPUB Accessibility as W3C Recommendation in 3 years

 notes may work for some things, but with a11y we may need recs

> *BillMcCoy*: sorry to use the word "trump" ;-)

*(ivan)* **Proposed resolution: This should be accepted as such**

*(ivan)* **Proposed resolution: This should also be accepted as such**

> [***Resolution #1: This should be accepted as such 1st***](id:resolution1)

> [***Resolution #2: This should also be accepted as such bizony bizony***](id:resolution2)

**garth:** EPUB3 exists in ISO world  I think we should get this in the charter at least for discussion  but more discussions to come about where the work would happen

**clapierre1:** the a11y task force will meet this Thursday to draft something for the charter

**garth:** there's nobody on the queue  I thought the wcag discussion would take moments  but it may be good in that Leonard is missing  and he kicked off the initial discussions of the PWP topics  the discussion last week about the definition of web publication, and the text about a11y--both of those were drafted by Ivan, so those are resolved  so I'd consider that finished, then we can move to online/offline and manifests next week

> *ivan*: --- adjurned

 and as the hour has past, we are done!  thanks to the a11y task force!

> *garth*: And from the agenda for this week, we did items: 1,2,4,5, and 3.1
