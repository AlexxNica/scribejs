16:03:31 <TimCole> Topic: Status of Notes and Recs
16:03:50 <TimCole> ivan: all final pre-pub editorial has been done and the docs are ready
16:04:06 <TimCole> ... formal request to publish Notes will go out after this meeting
16:04:24 <TimCole> ... what is status of Activity Stream items that we reference
16:05:16 <TimCole> azaroth: The Web Anno test json-ld instances are not pure AS so don't pass the AS automated testing
16:06:00 <TimCole> ... but the actual compliance test reports are generated by hand, so I was able to submit my results from my implementation
16:06:07 <takeshi> takeshi has joined #annotation
16:06:23 <TimCole> ... we can do same for another of the Web Anno implementations
16:06:52 <TimCole> ivan: 2 questions: first, do all the AS terms we use have requisite number of implementation?
16:06:56 <TimCole> azaroth: yes
16:07:10 <azaroth> Found the report: http://as2.amy.gy/reports.html
16:07:14 <TimCole> ivan: 2nd question how about the rest of the AS terms?
16:07:29 <TimCole> azaroth: not clear - can't see full report
16:07:56 <TimCole> ivan: so we don't know if/how close they are to moving beyond CR
16:09:05 <TimCole> ... we may need some statment in the Web Anno Vocab pertaining to the status of the AS recs at time the Web Anno docs are published
16:09:06 <tbdinesh> tbdinesh has joined #annotation
16:09:39 <TimCole> ... might Rob be able to provide a list of AS terms we are using
16:09:47 <tbdinesh> Present+ TB_Dinesh
16:10:03 <TimCole> azaroth: that should be easy because of how we structured the vocab doc
16:10:48 <TimCole> ivan: yes, this is in the recommended ontologies section - so that's all I need?
16:11:30 <PaoloCiccarese> PaoloCiccarese has joined #annotation
16:11:51 <TimCole> azaroth: Benjamin, could you send to AS a similar report to Rob's regarding Wiley's implementation?
16:12:11 <TimCole> bigbluehat: yes, but difficult to get done today
16:12:37 <PaoloCiccarese> Present+ Paolo_Ciccarese
16:13:04 <TimCole> ivan: by Tuesday? so that I can send out request to publish on Wed European time
16:13:27 <TimCole> bigbluehat: not Wiley's implementation but reference implementation, right?
16:13:39 <TimCole> TimCole: my mistake
16:14:42 <TimCole> Topic: Other changes since last week
16:14:55 <TimCole> ivan: Takeshi's input added to Selector Note
16:15:18 <TimCole> ... editiorial and json-ld updates were made to the HTML serialization note
16:15:51 <TimCole> ... passed all checks - 1 example in protocol doc had to be manually edited (post-respec)
16:16:43 <TimCole> ... Notes comment period has closed; Rec (PR) closes Tuesday midnight Boston
16:17:30 <TimCole> Topic: Blog announcement (due before 21 Feb)
16:18:33 <TimCole> ivan: can't use any of the comments entered during PR vote (member confidential), but can contact members who voted to see if they would like to provide us comments to include in blog
16:19:32 <TimCole> azaroth: will take first stab on flight to UK tomorrow
16:21:17 <tbdinesh> Will read

16:31:42 <TimCole> TimCole: after publication Rob/Tim/Paolo will post some sort of announcement to CG
