## Current status

* Tool does a reasonable output on some test irc log, needs to test it with more
* The markdown is currently sent to the standard output. The -o option does not work yet, and I should explore whether it is possible to dump the file on a github repo programatically.

## To do

* Manage the output. Is it realistic at all to push things to github automatically?
* Possibility to use a configuration file as part of an input, rather than command line arguments only
